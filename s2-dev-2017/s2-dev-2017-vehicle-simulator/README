How to
======

To simulate the behavior of the vehicle, select a temporary folder in the
configuration panel, and click "Démarrer". The simulator will continuously
update the variables in the different files it will create in the temporary
folder.

When the simulator is running, you may stop and reset it by pressing "Arrêter".
You may ask the vehicle to stop. If you do so, the vehicle will smoothly stop
after a few seconds. When the simulation is running and you asked the vehicle
to stop, you may request it to charge. You may stop the charging process by
clicking "Arrêter de charger" or "Faire rouler le véhicule".
